!!! Notes about the usage is in the script.js file.

Usage:
Intersection Observer in my opinion is the most useful because of how easy it makes things like infinite scrolling, lazing loading images, and scroll based animations.

-------------

You can also pass an array to threshold which means that the Intersection Observer will fire each time your element passes one of the thresholds passed to it.
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      entry.target.innerText = `${Math.round(entry.intersectionRatio * 100)}%`;
    });
  },
  { threshold: [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] }
);

-------------

Stop observing:
This can be done with the unobserve method or the method which are both methods on the Intersection Observer.
The unobserve method takes a single element as its only parameter and it stops observing that single element.
The disconnect method takes no parameters and will stop observing all elements.

new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      lazyLoadImage(entry);
      observer.unobserve(entry.target);
    }
  });
});
